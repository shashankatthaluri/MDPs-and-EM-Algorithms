## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are mathematical frameworks for modeling decision making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker. 
MDPs are useful for studying optimization problems solved via dynamic programming and reinforcement learning.

This project discusses:
- What are MDPs
- Solving MDPs using Value Iteration algorithm
- Example of MDP - Recycling Robot
- Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm
- Implementing EM algorithm using reaction networks

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes:

Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Knowledge of Markov Decision Processes and Reinforcement Learning
- Basic understanding of Expectation Maximization algorithm

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
To use this project, follow the steps below:

- Run main.py to learn about MDPs and solve using Value Iteration algorithm
- Check recycling_robot.py for an example MDP - Recycling Robot
- Refer em_algorithm.py to understand EM algorithm
