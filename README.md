# MDPs-and-EM-algo
The Project is about understanding of Reinforcement Learning with different examples, Markov decision Process and Expetation Maximization Algorithm. In this process I took an example called Human-robot which picks up the trash cans by travelling. And how the robot been rewarded. What the method been used to maximize the reward and few other analysis part too.

Topics I learned during this project 
- Reinforcement learning 
- Markov Decision Process (MDPs)
- Expetation Maximizatioin (EM) Algorithm

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are mathematical frameworks for modeling decision making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker. 
MDPs are useful for studying optimization problems solved via dynamic programming and reinforcement learning.

This project discusses:
- What are MDPs
- Solving MDPs using Value Iteration algorithm
- Example of MDP - Recycling Robot
- Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm
- Implementing EM algorithm using reaction networks
