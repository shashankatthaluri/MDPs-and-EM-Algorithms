# MDPs-and-EM-algo
The Project is about understanding of Reinforcement Learning with different examples, Markov decision Process and Expetation Maximization Algorithm. In this process I took am example called Human robot which picks up the trash cans how the robot been rewarded. What the method been used to maximize the reward and few other analysis part too.

Topics I learned during this project 
- Reinforcement learning 
- Markov Decision Process (MDPs)
- Expetation Maximizatioin (EM) Algorithm
